- **Description**: `AI-powered enterprise search with dynamic authentication`

### Scopes/Permissions:
- ‚úÖ `read:user`
- ‚úÖ `read:connections` 
- ‚úÖ `write:connections`

## If You Still Can't Find It

### Check Your Account Type
Some Pipedream accounts might have limited access to OAuth features:

1. **Free Account**: May have restrictions
2. **Developer Account**: Should have full access
3. **Team Account**: May need admin permissions

### Alternative: Contact Pipedream Support
If the OAuth app creation is not available:

1. Go to Pipedream documentation
2. Look for "OAuth" or "Developer" sections
3. Contact their support for guidance

## Screenshots to Look For

When you find the right page, you should see:
- Form with "Application Name" field
- "Redirect URI" or "Callback URL" field  
- Scopes/permissions checkboxes
- "Create App" or "Save" button

## Next Steps After Finding It

1. **Fill out the form** with the values above
2. **Save/Create** the application
3. **Copy the credentials** (Client ID, Client Secret)
4. **Update your .env file** with the new credentials
5. **Test the OAuth flow** in Slack

## If This Becomes Too Complex

Remember, we have the **Google OAuth alternative** ready to go, which is much simpler to set up!
